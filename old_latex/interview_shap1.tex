\subsection{Interview version SHAP1}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What would you describe as a good explanation? Phrased in a different way: what are the characteristics of a good explanation?

    \item Here will follow some sentences. Your task is to create a prediction and explanation of that situation. First let the user give any answer they want. Then make them pick the words that are most indicative of your prediction. \begin{itemize}
        \item "Road, garden and driveway officially flooded"
        \item "Queensland counts flood cost as New South Wales braces for river peaks"
        \item "Queensland does not deserve this flood trauma \& nightmare again. I hate it for them."
        \item "Insurance Talk: Queensland flood claims exceed \$44.8 million, likely to hit \$52.1 million soon"
        \item "Harsh country delivers harsh lessons: Fire, flood and other natural disasters are part of life in Australia"
    \end{itemize}

    \item Here will follow 3 sets of explanations. Your task is to select the best explanation from each set. \begin{enumerate}

    \item Here will follow one explanation. Your task is to remember the explanation while you are doing another task. \begin{itemize}
        \item Sentence to be explained: "Not long ago we were driving around Queensland marvelling at roadside poles showing high-water levels in the previous flood. Mind-boggling."
        \item Prediction: relevant;
        \item Explanation: "high", "water", "levels", "flood"
    \end{itemize}
    Now double the number 2 until the sum of the digits is 14 or larger.
    Do you remember the explanation (first with, then without the sentence?
    \todo{Write down which principles these explanations fit}
    
    \item And another explanation that you need to remember during another task. \begin{itemize}
        \item Sentence to be explained: "Queensland floods: 3 dead, thousands isolated: Three people are now dead as Queenslandâ€™s flood crisis escalates."

    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Judging the principles, from your experience during this interview (yes/no/maybe/no idea): \begin{enumerate}
        \item Would you say it is important for an explanation to be close to reality? [fidelity]
        \item Would you say explanations need to be complete, meaning they need to explain many cases? [completeness]
        \item Would you say short explanations are generally better than long ones? [compactness]
        \item Would you say that, when explaining specific events, unique characteristics of that event should be used? [distinctiveness]
        \item Would you say that explanations of a prediction should mention what would have to change to have a different prediction? [contrast]
    \end{enumerate}
